# hello-world
My name is U44253. Of course, that's not the name my mother gave me, but it IS my name. It's also an inmate ID number. I know. You're probably thinking, "well, if it's a number, how can it be your name?" It just is. That's how it is in DoC. You have a number, not a name.

BUT... 

It's not just ANY Inmate ID Number. It's the one that was assigned to Andrew Brian Boyett in May of 2018 when he arrived at RMC Lake Butler for his reception into the Florida Dept. of Corrections, where he began work on a mixed-media, semi-fictionalized, auto-biographical, literary, artistic endeavor which he somewhat satirically titled: "Things That Happened." The purpose of this repository is to catalogue and organize any and all programming or coding-based elements of that project.
